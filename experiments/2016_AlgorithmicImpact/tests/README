Run a script with -h for help.

Each file here is a shell script that runs an experiment. They take two
arguments:

1. Path to geodb.

2. Job directory (should not exist).

3. Number of cores per process.

Conventions:

* scripts named `.jex` use jexplode to create a job, while scripts named
  `.imm` execute the experiment immediately.

* comment at the top of the script says a little about the experiment.

* put options one per line in the order specified by `model-test --help`.

`model-test` and `jexplode` should be in your PATH.
